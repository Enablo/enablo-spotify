Enablo Spotify is a quick Workplace by Facebook Group integration that powers Enablo Radio. Internally we use this to build
a community around our love of music.

## Running the tests

Tests are coming, just wanted to get the code up and bug fixed first.

## Deployment

A rough outline on how to deploy is available, but we will look to clean it up in the short term once a couple of installation bugs are resolved - see the [SETUP.md](SETUP.md) file for details
